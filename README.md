### What I learned

Building a QR code component using just HTML and CSS was a valuable learning experience. Here's what I gained from the process:

Understanding the Simplicity of HTML: I realized how powerful HTML can be, even for creating complex components like QR codes. By leveraging semantic elements and maintaining a clean structure, I was able to build a flexible and responsive QR code container.

CSS Styling Techniques: Styling the QR code was an interesting challenge. I learned how to precisely control the layout, borders, and spacing using CSS. It gave me better insight into creating pixel-perfect designs without the need for external libraries.
